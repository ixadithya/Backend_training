The       quiet         cafe  on   the   corner slowly filled with people escaping the afternoon rain each carrying small stories and warm cups of coffee in the cafe. Some opened laptops others watched the street and a few simply enjoyed the gentle hum of conversation. Outside              puddles reflected the gray sky while inside time felt softer and unhurried.
